# [Omnifocus-Habitica-Link](http://seanlaidlaw.com/productivity/)
Scripts to allow a transfer of tasks from Omnifocus to Habitica.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/SL-LAIDLAW/Omnifocus-Habitica-Link`

For the Applescript to work properly, you'll have to create a script in the Script Editor saved as a binary .scpt file in the directory below. This script should have a simple "run script [ directory where you did the git clone]/Task to Habitica.applescript" command so you can use this script from the Omnifocus menu bar.
                         
`~/Library/Application Scripts/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2/`

In the git clone directory make sure to create a file "config.txt" where the first line is your user key and where the second line is your API code. You can get both of these from your habitica settings page.
